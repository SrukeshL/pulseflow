# PulseFlow Roadmap

#### Phase 1 — Core Performance Case (Completed / In Progress) ###
- Batch ETL performance optimization
- Streaming consumer lag reduction
- SQL pushdown vs Python processing experiments
- Observability-first debugging

#### Phase 2 — Platform Maturity ###
- Config-driven pipelines
- Resource controls and backpressure handling
- Failure scenario documentation

#### Phase 3 — Self-Service Analytics (Planned) ###
- Read-only analytics models
- Pre-aggregated performance metrics
- Real-time vs delayed freshness contracts
- Lightweight dashboard notes (no heavy BI dependency)

This roadmap intentionally prioritizes clarity and correctness
over premature scale.
