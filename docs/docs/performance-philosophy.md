# Performance Philosophy

PulseFlow is guided by the following principles:

1. Measure before optimizing
2. Push computation closer to data
3. Prefer batching over chatty operations
4. Make performance regressions observable
5. Design recovery paths before failures occur

These principles are repeatedly validated through experiments
and before/after metrics.
