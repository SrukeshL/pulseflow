- A hybrid data pipeline experienced increasing batch runtimes and streaming consumer lag as data volume grew.
- Identify performance bottlenecks, restore SLAs, and improve system observability.
- Replaced full table scans with incremental extraction
- Pushed aggregation logic into SQL
- Introduced batch processing for Kafka consumers
- Added metrics to isolate I/O vs CPU bottlenecks
- Reduced batch runtime by ~70%
- Reduced consumer lag from tens of minutes to under 2 minutes
- Improved system stability and debuggability
