#### PulseFlow aligns with common data platform engineering expectations across modern technology companies:

- Performance ownership over blind scaling
- Strong SQL and data modeling fundamentals
- Explicit tradeoff documentation
- Observability as a first-class feature
- Systems designed for evolution, not perfection

#### This project demonstrates how I think and make engineering decisions, not that I have built 
#### or operated systems at the same traffic, data volume, or scale as a specific large company.
